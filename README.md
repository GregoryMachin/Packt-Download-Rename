# Packt-Download-Rename
- I wrote this as a coding exercise. 
- This script is intended for the bulk renaming of book and associated sample code files. 
  where PDF is named <numbers>-<Name>.pfd will be renamed to <Name>.pfd
  if there is and accompanying code file <number>_Code.zip  file it will be renamed <Name>_Code.pdf  
  where <Name> is the of the pdf.
